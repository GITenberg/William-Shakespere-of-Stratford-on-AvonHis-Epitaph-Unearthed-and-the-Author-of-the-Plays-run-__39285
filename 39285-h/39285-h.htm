<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="smcap">William Shakespere&rsquo;s Epitaphs and
Chairs at Stratford-on-Avon</span>.</h2>
<p>There is one point above all others which bears strongly
against the theory that William Shakspere, of Stratford-on-Avon,
was the author of the so-called Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays, and
that is the audacious doggerel which has been fathered on his
memory.&nbsp; William Shakspere, after a disreputable youth,
marrying at 17 or 18 a woman many years older than himself, whose
child was soon after born, the son of a father who could not
write his name, and in debt and difficulty, and who himself
(p&egrave;re) had been within the clutches of the law, found his
native place too hot to hold him, and if the universal tradition
on the subject is worth anything, having a warrant out against
him for poaching, &ldquo;flitted&rdquo; to London, became a
stage-player, went in for speculation in building a theatre, laid
out his modest earnings judiciously, bought a house in his native
place, another in London &ldquo;within the precinct of the late
Black Fryers,&rdquo; retired to New Place, died, and was buried
in the church of that dirty town, in <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>1616, in the chancel, and his epitaph
inscribed at his request upon his tomb.&nbsp; He appears to have
been in the habit of writing or quoting such, and got the credit
for this sort of poetry from his companions.&nbsp; It is plain
from the evidence I produce (p. 7) that in and about those years
it was the custom in London churches to put verses of
questionable merit on monuments and tombs, that it was usual to
&ldquo;crib&rdquo; or copy them from some one else, and use them
as their own.&nbsp; The instances I give (and their name is
legion) shows this clearly to have been an every-day
practice.&nbsp; The play-actor, with a memory sharpened &ldquo;by
learning his parts,&rdquo; had no doubt seen them on the walls of
churches during his residence in London, and was in the habit of
repeating and passing off as his own these doggerel rhymes for
the edification and amusement of his companions and select
friends; but when asked to give them an <i>extempore</i> one
(evidently there was a leetle doubt as to his powers of
composition), knocked off one or two much inferior to those his
memory had retained (p. 11).&nbsp; What a specimen of their high
literary taste and also of his own, requesting to have such
rubbish inscribed upon his grave!&nbsp; No doubt there were many
other such-like epitaphs in churches in London which have been
destroyed or effaced by lapse of time, but these are a sufficient
specimen to show how little variation there is in them, and that
mainly in the spelling.&nbsp; The epitaph on the stone over
Shakspere&rsquo;s grave has been pressed into the service by a
believer in his writings to prove&mdash;first, that he
&ldquo;curst those who should move his bones,&rdquo; because that
he was fearful that when his renown was acknowledged, his bones
would be moved from their last resting-place in the Stratford
that he loved, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>to find a grave (they have a monument) in Westminster
Abbey! and secondly, by a non-believer, that when the imposture
was found out, they would be exhumed and cast out to the four
winds of heaven!&nbsp; But how about poor &ldquo;Virginea
<i>optima vita</i> El. 21,&rdquo; whose Covent Garden grave had
on its surface the same curse &ldquo;for he that moves my
bones&rdquo;?&nbsp; Did her people fear that some after-scandal
might occur to show that she was no better than Ann Hathway or
Jane Shore, and her ashes be scattered in the swollen flood of
the Fleet stream! or that an unknown princess or poetess
unrecognised, cared not for a niche in Poet&rsquo;s Corner or a
sepulchre amongst the great ones of the land, should her real
self and character ever be found out!&nbsp; In searching for
epitaphs of a similar style I found the following, which I give
as illustrative of what I have mentioned above.&nbsp; They are
extracted from an ancient folio, 1736 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, The History of London, by William
Maitland, F.R.S., which gives an account of the several parishes
and churches.</p>

<p>I have in my possession a Tour through England, by the Rev. R.
Warner, in 1801; he gives an account which I have never seen
alluded to, of a visit to Stratford-on-Avon.&nbsp; The mention of
&ldquo;cupboard, chair, and tobacco-stopper&rdquo; is
delightful.&nbsp; Vol. II. p. 272, Topographical Works of Rev. R.
Warner, 1802.&nbsp; &ldquo;On inquiring for the birth-place of
our great poet, we were not a little surprised to be carried
through a small butcher&rsquo;s shop into a dirty back room;
which, together with a miserable apartment above stairs,
constituted the greater part of the house of his father, Mr. John
Shakespeare, a wool-stapler, in the sixteenth century, where
William was born April 23, 1564.&nbsp; Here are piously preserved
the chair in which he sat, and the cupboard in which he kept his
books.&nbsp; A tobacco-stopper also was shown us, said to be that
which he had been accustomed to use for some years; but as we
found this inestimable relic might have been purchased for
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and that parts of the chair and cupboard
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>might be
procured upon similar reasonable terms, we were as much inclined
to give credit to their genuineness, as we had felt ourselves
willing to believe the traditions of Guy Earl of Warwick, his
shield, sword, and porridge-pot.&nbsp; Homely as the tenement
was, however, we had much gratification in recollecting that it
had been the birth-place of our great poet, and the scene where
the first dawning of his gigantic intellect was
displayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shakespeare, you know, had quietly settled himself in
his father&rsquo;s trade of a wool-dealer, and to insure greater
steadiness in his pursuit of business, had taken unto himself a
wife, the daughter of one Hathaway, in the neighbourhood of
Stratford.&nbsp; Good-nature or incaution, however, led him into
the society of some idle youths, who committed occasional
depredations in the parks of the surrounding gentry.&nbsp; Being
detected in a nocturnal adventure of this kind upon the property
of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Chalcot, near Stratford, he was prosecuted
for the offence; and irritating the prosecutor to a still greater
degree of violence, by an abusive ballad, he was under a
necessity of avoiding the effects of the criminal process, by
quitting his business and family at Stratford, and hiding himself
in the Metropolis.&nbsp; Some instances of his poetical sarcasms
are upon record, but local tradition confirms the assertion now
made of their just application.&nbsp; They are written on John
Coombe and his brother Tom, both notorious for penury and
usury.&nbsp; The former, in a party at which Shakespeare was
present, had sportively observed, that he apprehended the poet
meant to write his epitaph in case he outlived him, but as he
should lose the benefit of the composition if it were deferred
till his <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>death, he begged it might be done whilst he lived, that
he might admire the tribute, and thank the writer; Shakespeare
immediately presented him with the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten in the hundred lies here engrav&rsquo;d,<br />
Tis a hundred to ten his soul is not sav&rsquo;d;<br />
If any man ask, &lsquo;Who lies in this tomb?&rsquo;<br />
Oh!&nbsp; Oh! quoth the Devil, &rsquo;tis my John a Coomb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The epitaph upon the brother, whether called for or
not, I cannot say, is of a similar spirit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thin in beard, and thick in purse,<br />
Never man beloved worse;<br />
He went to the grave with many a curse;<br />
The devil and he had both one nurse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A flat stone, lying on the pavement over the place of
his interment, has this inscription, said to have been written by
Shakespeare for his own monument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good friend, for Jesus&rsquo; sake forbeare<br />
To digg the dust encloased heare;<br />
Blest be the man that spares these stones,<br />
And curst be he that moves my bones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another also ascribed to him quoted in
&ldquo;Shakspere&rsquo;s Poetry,&rdquo; No. 6, Bacon Society
Journal, p. 245, which, with the Goliath, makes up the number to
five.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Epitaph on <span
class="smcap">Elias James</span>.&nbsp; [Mark the lost H.]</p>
<p>When God was pleased, the world unwilling yet,<br />
Elias James to nature paid his debt,<br />
And here reposeth, as he lived he died,<br />
The saying in him strongly verified,<br />
Such life, such death: then the known truth to tell,<br />
He lived a godly lyfe and dyed as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The
other account of a visit paid, and chair and relics bought, is
taken from Samuel Ireland, London, 1795, a handsome volume of
well-executed picturesque views of the Avon, and buildings
connected with Shakesperian localities, which are generally made
use of without acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As such we shall conduct them to the humble cottage in
which he first drew breath, on the 23rd of April, 1564.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The annexed sketch of it was made in October,
1792.&nbsp; Part of these premises which belonged to Shakspeare
are still occupied by a descendant of Joan Harte, sister to our
Poet, who pursues the humble occupation of a butcher.&nbsp; His
father Thomas Harte died about a year ago at the age of
sixty-seven.&nbsp; The kitchen of this house has an appearance
sufficiently interesting to command a place in this work,
abstracted from its claim to notice as a relative to the
bard.&nbsp; It is a subject very similar to those that so
frequently employed the rare talents of Ostade, and therefore
cannot be deemed unworthy of the pencil of an inferior
artist.&nbsp; In the corner of the chimney stood an old oak
chair, which had for a number of years received nearly as many
adorers as the celebrated shrine of the Lady of Loretto.&nbsp;
This relic was purchased in July, 1790, by the Princess
Czartoryska, who made a journey to this place in order to obtain
intelligence relative to Shakspeare; and being told he had often
sat in this chair, she placed herself in it, and expressed an
ardent wish to become a purchaser; but being informed that it was
not to be sold at any price, she left a handsome gratuity to old
Mrs. Harte, and left the place with apparent regret.&nbsp; About
four months after, the anxiety of the Princess could no longer be
withheld, and her secretary was despatched express, as the fit <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>agent, to
purchase this treasure at any rate; the sum of twenty guineas was
the price fixed on, and the secretary and chair, with a proper
certificate of its authenticity on stamped paper, set off in a
chaise for London.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a lower room of the public-house, which is part of
the premises wherein Shakspeare was born, is a curious ancient
ornament over the chimney, relieved in plaster, which, from the
date 1606, that was originally marked on it, was probably put up
at the time, and possibly by the poet himself; although a rude
attempt at historic representation, I have yet thought it worth
copying.&nbsp; In 1759 it was repaired and painted in a variety
of colours by the old Mr. Thomas Harte before mentioned, who
assured me the motto then round it had been in the old
black-letter, and dated 1606.&nbsp; The motto runs thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Golith comes with sword and spear,<br />
And David with a sling;<br />
Although Golith rage and sweare,<br />
Down David doth him bring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harte, of Stratford, before mentioned, told me
there was an old oak chair, that had always in his remembrance
been called Shakspeare&rsquo;s courting chair, with a purse that
had been likewise his, and handed down from him to his
grand-daughter Lady Barnard, and from her through the Hathaway
family to those of the present day.&nbsp; From the best
information I was able to collect at the time, I was induced to
consider this account as authentic, and from a wish to obtain the
smallest trifle appertaining to our Shakspeare, I became a
purchaser of these relics.&nbsp; Of the chair I have here given a
sketch; it is of a <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>date sufficiently ancient to justify the credibility of
its history; and as to farther proof, it must rest on the
traditional opinion and the character of this poor
family.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smcap">Shakspere&rsquo;s After-Residence at
Stratford-on-Avon</span>.</h2>
<p>The nearest <i>reliable</i> authority we have for any story
connected with William Shakspere is the Vicar of
Stratford-on-Avon, a man of literary tastes, who kept a
voluminous journal, and it is he who gives us the account of
&ldquo;as I have heard, Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had
a merrie meeting, and it seems drank too hard, for Shakespeare
died of a feavour there contracted&rdquo; (was it at the house in
Blackfriars? they are hardly all likely to have been at
Stratford).&nbsp; Also in his Diary, &ldquo;Remember to peruse
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and bee much versed in them, that I may
not be ignorant in that matter. . . .&nbsp; Whether Dr. Heylin
does well in reckoning up the dramatick poets which have been
famous in England to omit Shakespeare?&rdquo;&nbsp; Note here
that Mr. Ward, although Vicar of the parish, and a man of high
education, was not acquainted with the works of Shakespeare
simply because he had not before realized the point that his
parishioner, whose descendants and relatives lived in humble
guise, was really the illustrious Shakespeare, whose praise was
in all mouths, and that therefore it was not necessary he should
be &ldquo;up in them,&rdquo; as they were not the subject of
conversation in the town of his birth and youth and burial,
clearly the pressure upon him to <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>get them up came later on from
without.&nbsp; He was not appointed to the Vicarage until
1662.</p>
<p>Diary of Rev. John Ward, from 1648 to 1679: &ldquo;I <i>have
heard</i> that Mr. Shakespeare was a natural wit, without any art
at all,&rdquo; and that is pretty well all the Vicar of his
native place heard tell of him as a writer of these plays.&nbsp;
He has nearly as much to say of &ldquo;Edmund Alline, a
stage-player, who founded the College of Dulwich.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have heard that Mr. Shakespeare was a natural wit
without any art at all: hee frequented the plays all his younger
time, but in his elder days lived at Stratford, and supplied the
stage with two plays every year and for itt had an allowance so
large that he spent at the rate of &pound;1000 a year as I have
heard.&rdquo;&mdash;From Diary of Rev. John Ward.&nbsp; How came
Shakespeare&rsquo;s brother stage-player to be worth thousands,
whilst the other&rsquo;s income saved was only about &pound;200
or at most &pound;300 a year?&nbsp; Was he the trusted middle
man, or Kemp, or both, in the secret?</p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays&mdash;Who Wrote them?</h3>
<p>There is a quaint story printed by the Camden
Society&mdash;Kemp&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nine Daies&rsquo;
Wonder,&rdquo; published 1600.&nbsp; Kemp was one of the leading
performers in that company in which Shakespere had subordinate
parts assigned him, and Edward Alleyne was chief manager.&nbsp;
Nash was a friend of his, and his tract, &ldquo;An Almond for a
Parrot,&rdquo; is dedicated to him, &ldquo;Monsieur du
Kempe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He talks of another great journey, and
signifies that he keeps it dark whether &ldquo;Rome, Jerusalem,
Venice, or any other place at your idle appoint&rdquo; (p.
20).&nbsp; One of his letters begins, &ldquo;My notable
Shakerags,&rdquo; mentions &ldquo;a penny poet, whose first
making <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>was
the miserable stolne story of Macdoel, or Macdobeth, or
Macsomewhat.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the Returne from
Parnassus&mdash;dialogue, &ldquo;<i>Phil.</i>&nbsp; What, M.
Kempe, how doth the Emperour of Germany?&nbsp;
<i>Student</i>.&nbsp; God save you, M. Kempe: Welcome from
dancing the morrice &lsquo;over the Alpes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<i>Kempe</i>.&nbsp; Is it not better to <i>make a foole of the
world as I have done</i> than to be fooled of the world as you
schollers are.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is also that well-known
allusion to &ldquo;our fellow Shakespeare putting them all down,
I and Ben Jonson too, and giving him a purge that made him beray
his credit&rdquo; (whatever that may mean).&nbsp; Also p. xiv,
&ldquo;The Travailes of the Three English Brothers, Sir Anthony,
Sir Thomas, and Sir Robert Shirley, as it is now play&rsquo;d by
Her Majesties Servants,&rdquo; the following scene is supposed to
take place at Venice:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Servant</i>.&nbsp; An
Englishman desires accesse to you.&nbsp; <i>Sir
Anthony</i>.&nbsp; What is his name?&nbsp; <i>Servant</i>.&nbsp;
He calls himself Kempe.&nbsp; <i>Sir. Ant.</i>&nbsp; Bid him come
in; Welcome, honest Will, and what good new plays have
you?&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Nash also speaks of Kemp as being at
Bergamo, and an Englishman from Venice meeting him there and
having a conversation on the &ldquo;order and maner of our
plays.&rdquo;&nbsp; These allusions, whether feigned or
otherwise, show there were communications going on between her
Majesties players and foreign parts, which were understood to be
connected with &ldquo;new plays&rdquo; and &ldquo;plays of
note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was there any distant connection between Will Kempe and Sir A.
Sherley?&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s name was Anne, daughter of Sir
Thomas Kempe, and had three sons&mdash;Thomas, Anthony, and
Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;No three persons of one family ever
experienced adventures at the same time so uncommon or so
interesting&rdquo; (from a book &ldquo;The Sherley
Brothers,&rdquo; by one of the same house, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>for Roxburghe
Club, Evelyn Philip Shirley).&nbsp; Sir Anthony married a first
cousin of the Earl of Essex, &ldquo;who had oftentimes to
befriend him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sent on embassies to every
quarter of the known world.&nbsp; Was ofttimes in communication
with Burleigh.&nbsp; We hear of him most in Italy, &ldquo;sent by
Emperor of Germany as ambassador to Morocco&rdquo;; &ldquo;hired
horses to pass the Alpes&rdquo; (see Kemp, p. 16); writes to
Anthony Bacon, a friend of Essex (p. 22).&nbsp; It appears that
he wrote many letters at this period to his patron Earl of Essex,
Mr. Anthony Bacon, and Mr. Secretary Cecil.&nbsp; He is found
everywhere, sometimes employed as ambassador, sometimes on
special missions, sometimes in questionable ventures.&nbsp;
Milan, Venice, where at one time he seems to have resided for
several years, Rome, Persia, Cyprus, Antioch, Syracuse, Prague,
Arabia, Tripoli, Aleppo, Bagdad, Constantinople, Portugal,
Spain.&nbsp; Sir Anthony appears (Annals of the Shirley Family)
with his brother Sir Robert to have always been in debt and
difficulty, &ldquo;sometimes like to starve for want of
bread,&rdquo; profuse and extravagant when money was to be had,
utterly careless how it was obtained.&nbsp; Mention is made of
&ldquo;Henry Sherley, kinsman of Mr. James Sherley, the
<i>play-wright</i>, and who did also excel him in that
faculty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry Sherley was the author of the
following plays never printed: Spanish Duke of Lerna, Duke of
Guise, Gasaldo the country lover (p. 270, Annals of Shirley
Family).&nbsp; Sir Anthony was ever aiming to get reinstated at
Court, and if he had been known to have been mixed up with these
plays, it would have been fatal to his chance with
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Clearly he had something to do with Will Kempe,
a member of Alleyn&rsquo;s company, who acted the prominent parts
in Two Gentlemen of Verona, Merchant of Venice, etc.&nbsp; Was
not &ldquo;Will Kempe&rdquo; the go-between <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the manager
and the author?&nbsp; Was it not necessary, in order to keep the
secret, that the MSS. should not pass from hand to hand, or be
entrusted even to the ambassador&rsquo;s bag?&nbsp; Lansdowne
MSS. 1608, Milan, Sir Anthony Sherley to his sister, Lady Tracy,
&ldquo;you will say, I should have written; it is true, but there
are such intercepting of my poor papers that before God I dare
commit nothing to paper, and now less than ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
extraordinary capacity and knowledge of languages and familiarity
with places and scenery by Sir Anthony Sherley, especially in
Italy, were clearly unequalled.&nbsp; What share had he in what
may be a joint-stock company for the production of these
plays?&nbsp; It is now acknowledged that many of the plays are
translated from Italian plays and other novels.&nbsp; Did he
bring this grist to the mill, find novels and stories, translate
them, and forward them by his trusted kinsman Kempe to others to
ship-shape them and fit them for the stage?&nbsp; May not the
name of Sherley have oozed out amongst &ldquo;the
playwrights,&rdquo; and thence &ldquo;<i>Henry</i> Sherley, who
excelled in that faculty,&rdquo; been spoken of as the man who
wrote them.&nbsp; Sir Anthony keeps up his friendship with
Anthony Bacon, whom no doubt he knew in earlier days at
Court.&nbsp; How fond they all were of the name of Anthony.&nbsp;
A greater knowledge of men and manners and languages and the
leading men and courtiers of the day or such a master of travel
existed not in his time.&nbsp; Strange also is it that &ldquo;The
Travailes of the three English Brothers, Sir Thomas, Sir Anthony,
and Mr. Robert Sherley,&rdquo; should be presented on the stage
by this same company of which Kempe was a member.&nbsp; How were
they acquainted with them?</p>
<p>These are all singular coincidences, and as I write I have
been <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>perusing Donnelly, and I find nothing to contradict, but
much to back up my theories.&nbsp; His chapter ix. vol. i. p.
171, also x. and others passim, might fit Sherley as well as
Bacon.&nbsp; (Shylock, p. 224.)&nbsp; Sherley borrows money
wherever he could get credit and at other times spends it
freely.</p>
<blockquote><p>He lends out money gratis, and brings down<br />
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.<br />
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br />
In the Rialto you have rated me<br />
About my monies and my usances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Anthony, has he not often &ldquo;sat on the Rialto&rdquo;?
has he not often watched the Argosies come &ldquo;to
road&rdquo;?&nbsp; Has he not had ventures everywhere?&nbsp; Read
over The Merchant of Venice, and say if it could possibly have
been written but by one resident there and half Italian in his
knowledge and familiarity with people and scenes in Italy
itself.&nbsp; What is Antonio everywhere but Anthony &ldquo;writ
new&rdquo;?&nbsp; See Sonnets, lxxvi.:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why write I still all <i>one</i>, ever the
same,<br />
And keep invention in a noted weed,<br />
That every word doth almost tell my name,<br />
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?</p>
</blockquote>

papers yellowed with their age,&rdquo; &ldquo;my muse,&rdquo;

sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; What in Othello?&nbsp; Cyprus on the brow of
the sea &ldquo;stand ranks of people and they cry a

<p>The leading qualifications for the author of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays to possess are summed up on the
medallion of Sir Anthony <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Sherley&rsquo;s picture, Antonius
Sherleyus Anglus Eques aurati (Annals of the Shirley Family,
second edition, p. 297, &ldquo;Multorum mores hominum qui vidit

the letter.&nbsp; He must have a familiarity with sylvan life,
its beauties, its copses, and its ferns and flowers; must have
mixed in youthful sports, hawked, <i>hunted the hare</i>, and
chased the roe and conies in his father&rsquo;s park at Wiston
(there is an ancient picture of the Lord of the Manor there,
issuing forth on a sporting expedition, p. 264).&nbsp; He no
doubt visited Chartley (Erdeswick&rsquo;s Staffordshire).&nbsp;
&ldquo;The park is very large and hath therein red deer, fallow
deer, wild beasts, and swine,&rdquo; passed on to Tamworth, the
ancient seat of Ferrers family (see Shirley Annals, p.

<span class="smcap">Mr. Donnelly&rsquo;s Cryptogram</span>.</h2>
<p>I have waited until I had Mr. Donnelly&rsquo;s book before
me.&nbsp; The marvellous industry, research and intelligence
displayed is simply astounding.&nbsp; I dare not express an
opinion on the subject.&nbsp; But why or wherefore should Bacon
take such an interest in and spend so much ingenuity on Anne
Hathaway and her marriage?&nbsp; It is a strange tale.&nbsp; I
have myself been Commissary for Bishops and held Courts for them;
have been for years a Surrogate for Bishops and Archbishops, and
have had now and then to refuse a license; but I never had or
heard of such a case as this, and should certainly have refused
to grant a license to allow &ldquo;<i>once</i>&rdquo; publishing
the banns to stand for &ldquo;<i>thrice</i>&rdquo; and to slur
over &ldquo;consent of parents.&rdquo;&nbsp; It most probably
happened that the banns were published the first time more or
less surreptitiously, and taking the parents by surprise were not
objected to; but if it proceeded to a second
&ldquo;asking,&rdquo; they would be forbidden; it is clear there
was an objection known to be hanging up.&nbsp; Turn the
bull&rsquo;s-eye light of common sense unto what was too common
in parishes of old.&nbsp; Who, why, and wherefore did Farmers
Sandells and Rychardson appear upon the scene?&nbsp; They, it may
be, held office in the parish, and had caught hold of a lad who,
to save the parish a burden or one of themselves a scandal, would
for a consideration make an &ldquo;honest woman of Ann
Hathaway.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>I myself recollect having a similar
case to deal with on all-fours&mdash;a farming lad of 19 or 20
and a woman of 29 or 30 near her confinement, when I felt so
strongly on the subject, that before the marriage ceremony, I
asked the intended bridegroom to come into the vestry to question
him as to his being in his sober senses, and if he understood
what was the position he was about to make for himself.</p>
<p>One error Mr. Donnelly has fallen into when he uses strong
language against William Shakespere for allowing &ldquo;one quart
of sack&rdquo; (p. 51) to be sent to his guest.&nbsp; It was a
common compliment to send such gifts, and the omission would have
been thought an insult.&nbsp; In Ambrose Barnes&rsquo; Memoirs
(p. 244) published by the Surtees Society, Appendix,
1592:&mdash;&ldquo;The Corporation of Newcastle-on-Tyne paid for
20 lb. of sugar in two loaves at 18<i>d.</i> a lb., 6 bottles of
sack, 10 pottles of white wine, 9 pottles of claret wine, sent as
a present to my Lord of Durham as he came travelling to this
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again (p. 427), 1684:&mdash;&ldquo;6<i>d.</i>
for one pint of sack when Mr. Shakespeare preached!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Also in Longstaff&rsquo;s Darlington (p. 239),
Churchwardens&rsquo; accounts, 1643:&mdash;&ldquo;One quart off
wine when Mr. Doughty preached, 10<i>d.</i>; one quart wine and
one pinte sack when another gentleman preached, which lay att
George Stevenson&rsquo;s, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>;&rdquo; 1650,
&ldquo;six quarts of sacke to the minister that preached when we
had not a minister, 9<i>s.</i>;&rdquo; 1666, &ldquo;one quart of
sack bestowed on Mr. Jellett when he preached, 2<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i>; more bestowed on him at Ralph Collings&rsquo;, when
Mr. Bell was there, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that my friends the public have a strong idea that this
subject has been thoroughly threshed out, and are apt to say and
think&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Donnelly is as bad,<br />
His Cryptogram it puzzles me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Cipher drives me mad.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I have an opinion that I have been able to fling
a few novel hints upon the question, and so cast it upon the
waters to sink or swim.</p>

26</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>Banns.</h3>
<p>Cripp&rsquo;s Laws of the Church, p. 634.&mdash;&ldquo;Before
the time of Pope Innocent III. there was no solemnization of
marriage in the Church: but the man came to the woman&rsquo;s
house and led her home to his own house, which was all the
ceremony then used.&nbsp; By the customs of the Anglo-Saxons the
marriage ceremony was commonly performed at the house of the
bridegroom, to which the bride had been previously taken.&rdquo;
(p. 638)&nbsp; &ldquo;It was formerly the law of this country
that marriages celebrated by licence, when either of the parties
was under the age of twenty-one years (not being a widow or
widower), without the consent of the father, or if he were not
living, of the mother or guardians, should be absolutely
void.&rdquo;&nbsp; They must proceed either by publication of
banns or by license.&nbsp; The word banns is of Saxon origin, and
signifies publication or proclamation (Rogers, E. L. 509).&nbsp;
This publication for three several Sundays or holidays, unless a
license or faculty had been obtained, was enjoined by Canon Law
and by the rubric &ldquo;in the time of divine service&rdquo; (p.
650). . . .&nbsp; For the avoiding of all fraud and collusion,
before such license shall be granted it shall appear to the judge
by the oaths of two sufficient witnesses . . . that the express
consent of the parents or parent is thereunto had and obtained
(Canon 103).&rdquo;&nbsp; It is singular we find <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>in Francis
Bacon&rsquo;s life, that he tried to break off the match with Sir
John Villiers and Lady Hatton&rsquo;s only daughter and heiress,
because the mother opposed it, &ldquo;he strongly advises that
the match be not proceeded in without the consent of both parents
required by religion and the law of God&rdquo; (Campbell&rsquo;s
Life of Lord Bacon, p. 138).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spurrings&rdquo; they are still called in the North of
England, where old customs and our fore-elders&rsquo; language
linger long.&nbsp; I myself in a parish in Wensleydale, where
they until recently &ldquo;raced for the garter,&rdquo; heard the
Clerk, to my astonishment, after I had finished the
&ldquo;spurring&rdquo; for the last time of asking, stand up and
in broad accent and loud voice sing out, &ldquo;God speed them
well!&rdquo; and all the people answered, Amen!&nbsp; It was not
any way ludicrous, but really sounded solemn and a beautiful
benediction from their fellow-parishioners.&mdash;(See
Atkinson&rsquo;s Glossary of Cleveland Dialect, &ldquo;Spurrings,
sb.&nbsp; The publication of banns of marriage: the being
&lsquo;asked&rsquo; at Church, an immediate derivative from
speer, speir, even if not directly from Old Norse
spyria.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The name of Shakespeare, Laborer, in the neighbourhood of
Stratford is spelt as above in George I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter Shakespeare, of Tachbrooke, in the county of
Warwicke, laborer, aged forty yeares or thereabouts, being sworne
and examined, deposeth as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the fourth interrogatory this deponent saith that
the cure of the parish has been neglected by the complainant, and
in particular this deponent&rsquo;s wife was put by being
churched, there being no Divine Service at Tachbrooke one Sunday
since the complainant&rsquo;s institucion and induction; and this
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>deponent
further says that notice was given that his wife was to be
churched that Sunday, and that this deponent was then and now is
an inhabitant of the parish of Tachbrooke.&rdquo;&mdash;Record

<p>See p. 22.&mdash;Ante &ldquo;Anthony Sherley and no other was
he who wrote these plays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since I wrote the first portion of this pamphlet so much
matter has turned up, showing beyond reasonable doubt that I am
right in my conjecture as to Anthony Sherley, that I am
encouraged to bring it also before the public.&nbsp; &ldquo;Magna
est veritas,&rdquo; and in due time the leaven will work its
way.</p>
<p>I had called attention (p. 20) to the Sonnets 135, 136,
105.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Sonnet</span> CV.</p>
<p>Let not my love be called idolatry,<br />
Nor my beloved as an idle show,<br />
Since all alike my songs and praises be<br />
To <i>one</i>, of <i>one</i>, still such and ever so.<br />
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,<br />
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;<br />
Therefore my verse to constancy confin&rsquo;d,<br />
<i>One</i> thing expressing, leaves out difference.<br />
Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words;<br />
And in this change is my invention spent,<br />
Three themes in <i>one</i>, which wondrous scope affords.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair, kind, and true, have often liv&rsquo;d
alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which three, till now, never kept seat in
<i>one</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">CXXXV.</p>
<p>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy <i>will</i>,<br />
And <i>will</i> to boot, and <i>will</i> in over-plus;<br />
More than enough am I that vex thee still,<br />
To thy sweet <i>will</i> making addition thus.<br />
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Wilt thou,
whose <i>will</i> is large and spacious,<br />
Not once vouchsafe to hide my <i>will</i> in thine?<br />
Shall <i>will</i> in others seem right gracious,<br />
And in my <i>will</i> no fair acceptance shine?<br />
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br />
And in abundance addeth to his store;<br />
So thou, being rich in <i>will</i>, add to thy <i>will</i><br />
One <i>will</i> of mine, to make thy large <i>will</i> more!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Think all but <i>one</i>, and me in that <i>one
Will</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the enigmatical allusions in them to Sherley&rsquo;s motto
&ldquo;only one.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not write &ldquo;only
one,&rdquo; as it would have betrayed the author of the plays,
but he shaves as near the wind as he dare, and as he says, Sonnet
lxxvi., which I mentioned (p. 19):</p>
<blockquote><p>Why write I still all one, ever the same,<br />
And keep invention in a noted weed,<br />
That every word doth almost tell my name,<br />
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so it does, when we look behind the scenes.&nbsp; They
were written in the hope that some one like myself would arise, a
light in a dark place, to give honour to whom honour was due, and
pluck the jay&rsquo;s false feathers from off the crow.&nbsp; The
instant you begin to look for it, you will observe how strangely
any-how and oft, in all times and places, in season and out of
season, this word &ldquo;<i>one</i>&rdquo; is wrought into the
text of the plays, sometimes in connection with
&ldquo;<i>all&rsquo;s one</i>&rdquo;; (he would not write
&ldquo;only one&rdquo; straight off, else it would have led, as I
said before, to detection, and so he uses the plural
&ldquo;all&rdquo; instead of singular &ldquo;only,&rdquo; see
Sonnet lxxvi.), and in a much more important position boldly puts
it forward (in Quarto 1608, with the name of Shakespeare)
&ldquo;<i>All&rsquo;s one</i> or <i>one</i> of the four plaies in
<i>one</i>,&rdquo; called &ldquo;A Yorkshire
Tragedy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this play with Anthony Sherley&rsquo;s
motto is nothing <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>more nor less than the story of the ruin of his house;
it is hardly disguised under the flimsy title of &ldquo;A
Yorkshire Tragedy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is important to note that of
all the plays this has no <i>stage names</i> to it, simply
&ldquo;Husband and wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange! passing
strange!&nbsp; Why should Shakespeare care to represent on the
stage the history of the Sherley family and ruin?&nbsp; This same
company, mark, had played it under the name openly of &ldquo;The
Three English Brothers,&rdquo; prologue, &ldquo;Clothing our
truth within an argument, fitting the stage and your attention,
yet not so hid but that she may appear to be herself, even
Truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would also fit the &ldquo;Yorkshire
Tragedy.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is the substance of the play?&nbsp; It
tells the story in blank verse, which we have almost word for
word in prose in &ldquo;The Sherley Brothers,&rdquo; viz. that of
Sir Thomas Sherley the elder gambling away his extensive

belonging to him except (Wiston), his wife&rsquo;s
dowry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Wife</i>: If you suspect a plot in
me to keep my dowry . . . you are a gentleman of many bloods;

to get him the offer of a place at Court, etc.</p>
<p>But the writer of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays was not content
with this, an exact account, even to <i>minute</i> particulars,
of the history of the three Sherley brothers; just compare that
history and this &ldquo;Yorkshire Tragedy&rdquo; play, and then
read the same story (Richard II.&nbsp; Act 2, scene 3).</p>

<p>Does not every thoughtful reader pause over it and say to
himself, why does he bring forward Busby and Green and rate them
and sentence them to death?&nbsp; What for? treason? rebellion?
murder? sedition? some rash crime?&nbsp; No; but for having
&ldquo;disparked&rdquo; his parks and pulled down &ldquo;his
impress&rdquo; (<i>only one</i>!), and his &ldquo;household
coat,&rdquo; and tells us what he would like to have done to his
enemies at Court if he had had the chance, as they had done when
they cut off his patron and his kinsman Essex&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
Now to return to the reason why he should have written a play to
unfold the reasons of his family decay.&nbsp; To Cecil from
Anthony Sherley, &ldquo;The worst sort of the world have taken
advantage to lay upon <i>me</i> all sorts of defamation&rdquo;
(p. 37), and again, and therefore to clear himself, he shows how
it came to pass, and that his father was not in his right senses
who incurred &ldquo;this great debt&rdquo; (p. 37, Sherley
Brothers).&nbsp; Elizabeth had actually
&ldquo;<i>distrained</i>&rdquo; upon his father&rsquo;s goods,
had carried off even his blankets and sheets, chairs and arras
hangings, feather beds, and silver spoons, and left his mother
scanty and beggarly supply for her dowry house, not sufficient
for the necessities of everyday life.&nbsp; She had seized and
sold the vast lands and possessions of his ancestors.&nbsp;
(Stemmata Shirleana, Roxburgh Club, p. 251.)&nbsp; &ldquo;A
description of the Manors sold, all save Wiston
dowry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1578 Sir T. Sherley served the
office of Sheriff for the counties of Surrey and Sussex.&nbsp; He
afterwards became Treasurer at War <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>in the Low Countries, and having
fallen under the displeasure of Queen Elizabeth, and become
indebted to the Crown, his estates and personal effects, with the
exception of the Manor of Wiston, settled on his wife, were
seized.&rdquo;&nbsp; See Lansdowne MSS. Goods seized at Wiston by
Sheriff, 1588.&nbsp; Here again I earnestly request comparison
with the story in the &ldquo;Yorkshire Tragedy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rowland Whyte, &ldquo;he owed the Queen more than he was worth;
his own doings have undone him.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">SCENE
IV.&mdash;HUSBAND&mdash;YORKSHIRE TRAGEDY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there in three dice to make a man draw thrice
three thousand acres into the compass of a little round table,
and with the gentleman&rsquo;s palsy in the hand shake out his
posterity thieves or beggars?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis done; I have don
&rsquo;t i&rsquo; faith; terrible, horrible misery!&mdash;How
well was I left!&nbsp; Very well, very well.&nbsp; My lands
show&rsquo;d like a full moon about me; but now the moon&rsquo;s
in the quarter&mdash;waning, waning; and I am mad to think that
moon was mine; mine and my father&rsquo;s, and my
fore-fathers&rsquo;; generations, generations.&mdash;Down goes
the house of us; down, down it sinks.&nbsp; Now is the name a
beggar&rsquo;s; begs in me.&nbsp; That name, which hundreds of
years has made this shire famous in me and my posterity, runs
out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the Rt. Hon. Sir R. Cecil, Knight, from Anthony
Sherley:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Arkangell, 1600,
June 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either the unfairness of the ways or messengers have
kept my letters from you.&nbsp; You have not vouchsafed me <i>one
only</i> answer . . . your honour knoweth the fortunes of my
house, and from how great expectations our sins or disasters
brought it both in estate and in disgrace . . . my purpose was to
satisfy the world <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>in myself that I was too worthy to have the decay of
myself laid on me.&rdquo;&mdash;The Sherley Brothers, p.
28.&nbsp; S. P. O.&nbsp; From Sir R. Cecil, 1600.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Her Majesty has increased her former displeasure towards
him so far in respect of this presumption as by no means she will
suffer him to come into the kingdome; but wholly rejected any
such offer&rdquo; (p. 31).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is, Elizabeth had been stung in her sorest
point.&nbsp; Sherley the elder was paymaster to the forces in the
Low Countries, and his accounts were deficient.&nbsp; That was
never to be passed over.&nbsp; She, who exercised her ingenuity
and talents in cheese-paring, who, whilst waiting for the coming
of the Armada, spent her time in trying whether, if she gave her
sailors fish and oil instead of salt beef, it would not save her
a penny or two a day from each separate mess; who never would
victual her ships or refit them, or give them shot or powder more
than enough for the day.&nbsp; It was owing to the pluck of the
half-starved, half-victualled British sailor in non-repaired
ships, and in spite of every disadvantage, that the victory was
won; not with her help, not with her providence, but in spite of
it.&nbsp; Well was it expressed, &ldquo;Her maddened grasp of
passionate avarice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Give the devil his due, as we
say in the proverb, but don&rsquo;t give one iota of credit to
that stingiest, and vainest of womenkind.&nbsp; Ray&rsquo;s
Glossary of words&mdash;&ldquo;Stingy, pinching, sordid, narrow
spirited.&rdquo;&nbsp; Read all these quotations from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, and compare them line with line and
the lives of Sherley&rsquo;s brothers, and conviction must
follow.&nbsp; I might just notice that Anthony Sherley&rsquo;s
knowledge of the localities and people where most scenes of the
plays are fixed was unequalled.&nbsp; He told that which he had
seen; he spoke of what he knew.&nbsp; Whateley on Shakespeare,
&ldquo;The characters which he has drawn are masterly copies from
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Now to
return to Sonnet 105, which has always been a stumbling block to
commentators, as it clearly was intended to explain some mystery
or enigma connected with the author of the plays.&nbsp; I have
never yet noticed any reasonably satisfactory explanation of this
Sonnet.&nbsp; Why even the person who wrote on the religion of
Shakespeare claims it as a sort of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Athanasian creed, and meant to express a belief in the Trinity,
&ldquo;three in one!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>All&rsquo;s
one</i>&rdquo; I noticed may be met with often; but as for
&ldquo;<i>one</i>,&rdquo; it crops up everywhere.&nbsp; In a
single scene in a single page you may count in places six
&ldquo;<i>ones</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Henry V.&rdquo; passim), in
many cases &ldquo;lugged&rdquo; in where the sense and context
show it would be far better otherwise, and commentators take
trouble to emend it.&nbsp; This is the key to his broad hint
(Sonnet lxxvi.), &ldquo;Why write I still all
&lsquo;<i>one</i>,&rsquo; ever the same . . . that every word
doth almost tell my name.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, conjoined with his
impress &ldquo;<i>one</i>,&rdquo; there is also a play upon his
&ldquo;armories,&rdquo; the Sherley Trinity of virtues.&nbsp; I
find in Lansdowne MSS., No. 49, leaf 28, which I have verified,
&ldquo;That armories were antiently introduced to distinguish
noble and illustrious families.&nbsp; The house of Shirley of
great estimation, &lsquo;Noble light,&rsquo; &lsquo;Gold,&rsquo;
it cannot be corrupted, or the value diminished by earth, water,
air, or fire.&nbsp; Gold and sunbeams signifies in virtues,
alluding to the Shirley family in particular, &lsquo;Field of
gold,&rsquo; faith, charitie, wisdom, and fidelitie, and many
others, all of which their arms are the true
emblems.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are several pages of this sort in
MSS. of British Museum relating to the Shirley family.&nbsp; May
not this be the Trinity of virtues mentioned in that puzzling
Sonnet 105, &ldquo;Three themes in <i>one</i>&rdquo;? <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>If
Anthony Sherley did not write the plays and sonnets, why does the
writer chronicle his every movement? (<i>passim.</i>)&nbsp; Why
does he give an exact account of his family history (Yorkshire
Tragedy), their ruin and his own banishment?&nbsp; Why again in
Richard II. Act ii. sc. 3, transforming it to himself in a
figure, give an account of their harsh treatment by
Elizabeth?&nbsp; Why does that same company act the Brothers
Sherley on the stage as well as the Yorkshire Tragedy (quarto W.
Shakespeare)?&nbsp; Why in all other plays but that alone are
there <i>stage</i> names, but in this play when acted (as he
wishes it not so to be), a Sherley had interest enough to get his
way?&nbsp; Why are all the scenes of the plays laid at places
where Anthony Sherley tarries?</p>
<p>Why does Kemp (with &ldquo;good new plaies&rdquo;), one of
this <i>same</i> company, go to meet him at places where he is
then known to be, &ldquo;over the Alpes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Venice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Emperor of Germany&rdquo; (Nine
Daies&rsquo; Wonder).</p>
<p>Why is it that Shakesperians have been so sure that their
claimant must have had a classical education, that they have
searched the records of Oxford and find no entry?&nbsp; Why do I
find &ldquo;Aula Cervina&rdquo; Antonius Sherlye,
1579&mdash;<i>equitis aurati</i> fil. 14 ann.&nbsp; Hart Hall is
thus described by a contemporary, 1st Elizabeth: &ldquo;By the
advantage of the most famous and learnedest of tutors he acquired
a knowledge not common of the Greek and Latin tongues, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of
philosophy, of history, of politicks and other liberal
sciences.&rdquo;&mdash;Would not Shakesperians have been
delighted if they could have this said of the tutors W.
Shakespere studied under!!</p>
<p>Why, as Clement&rsquo;s Inn is mentioned, are they sure he
must have had a legal training, but can find no mention?&nbsp;
Why, when I go to the Library of the Inner Temple, do I find at
once the name and record I want, covering just the very date I
need for my theory?&nbsp; &ldquo;1583, November, admitted Inner
Temple Sir Anthony Shirley, Wiston, Sussex, the second of the
celebrated brothers, died 1630.&rdquo;&nbsp; Extract from
&ldquo;Members admitted to the Inner Temple
1547&ndash;1660.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why is it the writer is so familiar
with the ins and outs, and changes, and intricate governments,
and of Italian states and cities, and their laws and ways?&nbsp;
Why does he mention what puzzles so many commentators, viz. that
Bohemia had a sea-board? <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; Why in
everyday talk does he bring in Venetian proverbs and ways of
speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fico,&rdquo; Heylin, p. 124, &ldquo;When
they intend to scoff a man, are wont to put their thumb between
two of their fingers, saying, &lsquo;Ecco le
Fico.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This would answer to our &ldquo;taking
a sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Must not the familiar use of this and
similar proverbs point to residence?&nbsp; &ldquo;Basta,&rdquo;
what a useful word one finds in it when dwelling in Italy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A Bergomask dance&rdquo; (Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream).&nbsp; Who could know, unless resident, that the Venetians
looked down on them as coarse and vulgar?&nbsp; Notice also all
sorts of trifling incidents which prove the writer was a dweller
at Venice, and moved about among the Italian States.&nbsp; Why is
he always harping upon ancient families being ruined, and the
hardship of banishment?&nbsp; Why <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>are all his provincialisms Sussex and
south country?&nbsp; &ldquo;The many musits through which he
goes&rdquo; (Venus and Adonis).&nbsp; &ldquo;A hare wee found
musing on her meaze&rdquo; (Return from Pernassus).&nbsp; Surrey
Provincialisms, G. Leveson Gower, &ldquo;Meuse, a hole in the
hedge made by a fox, hare, or rabbit, alias a run.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Musit occurs in Two Noble Kinsmen, III. i. 97.&nbsp; Halliwell
has muse and muset.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maund, a basket&rdquo;
(Ray&rsquo;s South Country Glossary).&nbsp; Why does he so
accurately, in smallest details, describe the horrors of a
battle-field, the sacking of a town, the horrible scenes and
impossibility of keeping in hand the soldiers?&nbsp; How, if he
had not been present, could he have imagined the meeting in
conclave and settling over night the lines of to-morrow&rsquo;s
battle?&nbsp; What did either Shakespere or Bacon know of that
phase of camp life, of battle in retreat and advance, the field
before and after, prisoners and their ransom, all true to the
letter, of one who had been with Philip Sidney and knighted on
the very field of battle in Brittany by the King of France, and
sent to the Fleet by Elizabeth&rsquo;s jealousy because he was so
knighted?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have I not heard in my time lions roar?<br
/>
Have I not heard the sea puffed up with winds<br />
Rage like an angry boar, chafed with sweat?<br />
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,<br />
And heavens artillery thunder in the skies?<br />
Have I not in a pitched battle heard<br />
Loud &rsquo;larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets
clang?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Taming of the Shrew.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this had Anthony Sherley heard and seen.&nbsp; Had
Bacon?&nbsp; Had John Bull&rsquo;s Stratford pet?&nbsp; Then, as
for field sports, hunting in every form or fashion, he describes
as none but he and Jorrocks could.&nbsp; (R. S. Surtees, of
Hamsterley, I know, drew all his pictures from <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>originals,
and that is why they hold their own.)&nbsp; The dying hare,
&ldquo;Venus and Adonis,&rdquo; was there ever anything more
touching?&nbsp; The same repeated, &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo;
Act II. i. the dying deer, and Jacques weeping over it.</p>
<p>Unless at home he had had an early introduction to stable and
kennel management, that sort of learning could not be acquired in
after-life; his love for his &ldquo;crop-eared roan,&rdquo; the
descriptions in so many places of his devotion to horses and
hounds, he knows them all by name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Taming of the
Shrew,&rdquo; scene 1, &ldquo;Huntsman, tender well my
hounds;&rdquo; see also Henry VI. scene 2.&nbsp; His description
of deer and deer hunts shows that he had watched their habits,
couchant and in chase.&nbsp; What a fund of similar knowledge is
there in the Return from Pernassus, <i>not</i> Parnassus,
distinguishing between the names at different seasons of their
life, and also the same of &ldquo;Roa-bucke,&rdquo; &ldquo;rode
on a roan gelding,&rdquo; &ldquo;the buck broke gallantly,&rdquo;
and then comes a similar touching description to that of the
death of the hare in the Sonnets, &ldquo;the hounds seized upon
him, he groaned, and wept, and dyed, in good faith it made me
weep too.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth is, when you compare the words
and sentiments and expressions with those in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays, <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> you feel that one and the same writer
was author of them both.&nbsp; Recollect that the modern
Pernassus was in the neighbourhood of Bergamo, from whence Kemp
had just returned from his visit to Anthony Sherley (see An
Almond for a Parrot), and, as Heylyn tells us,
&ldquo;Crema,&rdquo; the inhabitants of, on the destruction
&ldquo;of Parnassus, a town of Lombardy, where before they lived,
were permitted to build here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it is evident
that whoever wrote these plays was a <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Romanist, he sneers at Churchmen and
Puritans alike, whilst with regard to Friars and Romanists, he
mostly speaks of them with respect.&nbsp; Well, in S. P. O. there
is a letter from one Phillipp employed by Cecil &ldquo;to
intercept letters and spy out secrets,&rdquo; dated Rome, 1601:
&ldquo;He (Anthony Sherley) denyeth himself to have been a
Protestant ever since his first being at Venice, and here also he
hath used to frequent confession every seven or eight days, and
upon Easter Eve he did communicate here; upon Easter Day he dined
here in the English Colledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This will account for the attack on Sir John Oldcastle, egged
on by his Jesuit friends, and his dropping the subject when he
found that the wave of public opinion ran high against him.&nbsp;
Last, but not least, we have a few landmarks of localities.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Burton&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wincot&rdquo; stand out in
eminence.&nbsp; Far and near have they been sought after by
Shakesperians, but from Dan to Beersheba it is all barren; they
locate poor Christopher Sly here, there, and everywhere, or else
declare there must be mis-spelling; as follows is what one of the
best and shrewdest of the commentators is driven to: Steevens:
&ldquo;I suspect we should read Barton Heath.&nbsp; Barton and
Woodmancot, or as it is vulgarly pronounced, Woncot, are both of
them in Gloucestershire, near the residence of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s old enemy Justice Shallow.&nbsp; Very
probably also this fat ale wife might be a real
character.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Samuel Ireland, 1795: &ldquo;From the
similarity of the name and the consideration that no such place
as Barton Heath has been by any inquiry of mine discovered in the
neighbourhood, I am led to conceive that Barton Heath, which lies
in this county about 18 miles from Stratford, must have been the
spot to which Shakespeare refers.&nbsp; It is worth hazarding a
conjecture to have even a chance of tracing him in any one of his
haunts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>need not such subterfuges, but go
down to Stanford&rsquo;s and buy an Ordnance Map of Sussex, and
find <i>both</i> places within an easy reach of Wiston.&nbsp;
Names thereabouts seem to be strangely contracted,
Wystoneston=Wiston, St. Botulph&rsquo;s Bridge=Bootle Bridge, so
also Woodmancote and Edburton; but if that will not please for
Christopher Sly&rsquo;s residence (when at home?), there is
<i>another Burton proper</i>, within a few miles of Wiston;
Woodmancote and Edburton are next parish to Wiston, aye, and
joining on &ldquo;Nightingale&rdquo; Hill, how fond he was of
them, he gives us even their notes; his father&rsquo;s woods were
as full of them as his park of deer.&nbsp; There is no question,
it appears to me, I cannot answer, no puzzled point I cannot
explain, no stumbling-block to commentators I cannot take out of
their way.&nbsp; Why then not believe me?&nbsp; &ldquo;All the
world against nothing,&rdquo; Romeo, III. 5.&nbsp; Although I
have run a dark horse, he has run straight and true, and
distanced Bacon, whilst Shakespere has alike dropped out of both
betting and running. <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a>&nbsp; Shakesperians
have left their Dagon on the ground and hardly lift the feather
of a quill to raise him up.&nbsp; Their last resource in argument
is (fact) inspiration! in opposition ridicule!&nbsp; As to their
other candidate, that weakly youth never could have been
physically equal to have taken his share in youthful
sports.&nbsp; Campbell&rsquo;s Life of Bacon: &ldquo;Francis was
sickly and unable to join in the rough sports suited for boys of
robust constitution,&rdquo; if so he could not have described
them so vividly and true; his poetry, such specimens as we have,
is hardly-third rate, his prose on stilts, his history
discredited.&nbsp; Preface to Bacon&rsquo;s Essays, 1814:
&ldquo;His History of Henry VII. is in these days only consulted
by a few.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Can this be said of his
contemporary&rsquo;s Historical plays?&nbsp; Whilst I have known
those who have taken Bacon up and laid him down, I have hardly
ever known one who after he had put Shakepeare down with
reluctance, but longed for the time to take him up
again,&mdash;the one interested and enchanted, the other
bored.&nbsp; Never both the product of the same brain, or
writings of the same man.&nbsp; I have told my tale and run my
(paper) chase, and now leave it to my umpires, the British and
American readers, to decide whether, as Stratford has been pulled
up and Bacon distanced, I may not claim from every unprejudiced
mind that Sherley has been well ridden and won in a canter.&nbsp;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
